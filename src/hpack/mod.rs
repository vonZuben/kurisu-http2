/// An indexed header field representation identifies an entry in either the static table or the dynamic table (see Section 2.3).

/// Figure 5: Indexed Header Field
///
/// An indexed header field starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern, followed by the index of the matching header field, represented as an integer with a 7-bit prefix (see Section 5.1).
///
/// The index value of 0 is not used. It MUST be treated as a decoding error if found in an indexed header field representation.

/// 6.2 Literal Header Field Representation
/// A literal header field representation contains a literal header field value. Header field names are provided either as a literal or by reference to an existing table entry, either from the static table or the dynamic table (see Section 2.3).
///
/// This specification defines three forms of literal header field representations: with indexing, without indexing, and never indexed.

/// A literal header field with incremental indexing representation starts with the '01' 2-bit pattern.

/// If the header field name matches the header field name of an entry stored in the static table or the dynamic table, the header field name can be represented using the index of that entry.

/// A literal header field never-indexed representation starts with the '0001' 4-bit pattern.
///
/// When a header field is represented as a literal header field never indexed, it MUST always be encoded with this specific literal representation.

/// This representation is intended for protecting header field values that are not to be put at risk by compressing them (see Section 7.1 for more details).

/// A dynamic table size update starts with the '001' 3-bit pattern, followed by the new maximum size, represented as an integer with a 5-bit prefix (see Section 5.1).
///
/// The new maximum size MUST be lower than or equal to the limit determined by the protocol using HPACK. A value that exceeds this limit MUST be treated as a decoding error. In HTTP/2, this limit is the last value of the SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE parameter (see Section 6.5.2 of [HTTP2]) received from the decoder and acknowledged by the encoder (see Section 6.5.3 of [HTTP2]).
